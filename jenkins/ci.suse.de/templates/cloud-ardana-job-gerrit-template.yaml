          description: >-
            The virtual or hardware environment identifier. This field should either
            be set to one of the values associated with the known hardware environments
            (e.g. qe101), or to a value that will identify the created virtual environment.

            WARNING: if a virtual environment associated with the supplied cloud_env already
            exists, it will be replaced.

      - bool:
          name: reserve_env
          default: '{reserve_env|true}'
          description: >-
            Reserve the 'cloud_env' lockable resource throughout the execution of this job

      - choice:
          name: os_cloud
          choices:
            - 'engcloud'
            - 'susecloud'
          description: >-
            The target OpenStack cloud platform used as infrastructure for a
            virtual cloud deployment. Possible values are:

              engcloud  - the Provo engineering cloud (engcloud.prv.suse.net)
              susecloud - the Nuremberg SUSE cloud (cloud.suse.de)

            If the 'cloud_env' value (or the the reserved resource, when 'reserve_env' selected),
            matches one of the virtual cloud slots (https://ci.nue.suse.com/lockable-resources/),
            the 'os_cloud' parameter is overridden to reflect the OpenStack platform associated with it.

      - validating-string:
          name: GERRIT_CHANGE_NUMBER
          default: ''
          regex: '([0-9]+)'
          msg: The entered value failed validation
          description: >-
            A Gerrit change number to test (the latest available patchset number is assumed).

            For jobs triggered by Gerrit, the Gerrit change number and patchset number are
            extracted from the GERRIT_CHANGE_NUMBER and GERRIT_PATCHSET_NUMBER environment
            variables set by the trigger, which override this parameter.

      - validating-string:
          name: gerrit_context
          default: '{gerrit_context}'
          regex: '[A-Za-z0-9-_]+'

            Empty or malformed value (only alphanumeric, '-' and '_' characters are allowed).
          description: >-
            Unique job identifier. This string label uniquely identifies a job build within
            the set of builds running against the same Gerrit change.

            This value determines which of the job builds currently running for a Gerrit change
            are superseded and automatically canceled when a new job build is started.
            The rule is: there can be at most one job with a given 'gerrit_context' value running
            at any given time for a Gerrit change, voting or otherwise.

      - bool:
          name: voting
          default: '{voting|false}'
          description: >-
            Determines if this job posts Verified labels on target Gerrit changes.

            NOTE: there can be at most one voting Gerrit job running for a Gerrit
            change number. The most recent job will automatically abort those
            that are already running for the same Gerrit change number.

      - validating-string:
          name: integration_test_job
          default: '{integration_test_job}'
          regex: '[A-Za-z0-9-_]+'
          msg: >-
            Empty or malformed Jenkins job name (only alphanumeric, '-' and '_' characters are allowed).
          description: >-
            The Ardana Jenkins integration job triggered to validate the Gerrit change.

            NOTE: there can be at most one non-voting Gerrit job running the same
            integration test job for a Gerrit change number. The most recent job
            will automatically abort those that are already running for the same
            Gerrit change number and integration test job.

      - validating-string:
          name: extra_repos
          default: ''
          regex: '((http(s)?:\/\/[^ ,]+)(,http(s)?:\/\/[^ ,]+)*)*'
          msg: The entered value failed validation
          description: >-
            A comma separated list of repository urls to be added on the deployer node

            NOTE: The packages from those repositories will be available to all cloud nodes
            through a repository with a higher priority, meaning that those packages will be
            installed even if there is a newer package available on other repositories.

      - string:
          name: git_automation_repo
          default: '{git_automation_repo|https://github.com/SUSE-Cloud/automation.git}'
          description: >-
            The git automation repository to use

      - string:
          name: git_automation_branch
          default: '{git_automation_branch|master}'
          description: >-
            The git automation branch

      - string:
          name: os_project_name
          default: ''
          description: >-
            The name of the OpenStack project that hosts the virtual cloud deployment
            in the 'os_cloud' OpenStack cloud platform (leave empty to use the
            default shared 'cloud' account).

            If the 'cloud_env' value (or the reserved resource, when 'reserve_env' selected),
            matches one of the virtual cloud slots (https://ci.nue.suse.com/lockable-resources/),
            the 'cloud-ci' OpenStack project used exclusively for the Cloud CI will be used
            regardless of this parameter.

            This field may be used to define additional parameters, one per line, in the form:

              <parameter_name>=<parameter-value>

            These parameters will be injected into the Jenkins job as environment variables that supplement
            or override the other parameters configured for the Jenkins job.
            This should not be used by default or regularly. It is meant to run job build customized in ways
            not already supported by the job's parameters, such as testing automation git pull requests
            with special configurations.

      - hidden:

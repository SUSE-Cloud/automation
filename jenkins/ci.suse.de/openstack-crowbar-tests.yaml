            The virtual or hardware environment identifier. This field should either
            be set to one of the values associated with the known hardware environments
            (e.g. qe101), or to a value that will identify the created virtual environment.

            The OpenStack cloud platform where the virtual cloud environment is
            running. Possible values are:

              engcloud  - the Provo engineering cloud (engcloud.prv.suse.net)
              susecloud - the Nuremberg SUSE cloud (cloud.suse.de)

            If the 'cloud_env' value matches one of the virtual cloud slots
            (https://ci.nue.suse.com/lockable-resources/), the 'os_cloud' parameter is
            overridden to reflect the OpenStack platform associated with it.

            Name of the filter file to use for tempest. Selecting multiple values
            will run tempest for each selected value.

            Use an empty value to skip running tempest.

          description: >-
            The name of the OpenStack project that hosts the virtual cloud deployment
            in the 'os_cloud' OpenStack cloud platform (leave empty to use the
            default shared 'cloud' account).

            If the 'cloud_env' value (or the reserved resource, when 'reserve_env' selected),
            matches one of the virtual cloud slots (https://ci.nue.suse.com/lockable-resources/),
            the 'cloud-ci' OpenStack project used exclusively for the Cloud CI will be used
            regardless of this parameter.

            This field may be used to define additional parameters, one per line, in the form:

              <parameter_name>=<parameter-value>

            These parameters will be injected into the Jenkins job as environment variables that supplement
            or override the other parameters configured for the Jenkins job.
            This should not be used by default or regularly. It is meant to run job build customized in ways
            not already supported by the job's parameters, such as testing automation git pull requests
            with special configurations.

            Use this parameter to filter the list of jobs that are triggered to test the maintenance
            updates. This is useful e.g. when re-running only the subset of jobs that have failed
            during a previous run for environmental reasons.

            Leave empty to run all applicable jobs.

            This field may be used to define additional parameters, one per line, in the form:

              <parameter_name>=<parameter-value>

            These parameters will be injected into the Jenkins job as environment variables that supplement
            or override the other parameters configured for the Jenkins job.
            This should not be used by default or regularly. It is meant to run job build customized in ways
            not already supported by the job's parameters, such as testing automation git pull requests
            with special configurations.

/**
 * The openstack-ardana-bootstrap-clm Jenkins Pipeline
 *
 * This job sets up the CLM node by adding/updating software media and repositories,
 * SLES and RHEL artifacts, installing/updating the cloud-ardana pattern, etc.
 * The resulted CLM node can then be used directly to deploy an Ardana cloud or
 * snapshotted and cloned to be later on used to deploy several cloud scenarios
 * based on the same cloudsource media/repositories.

 * This job should only include steps that are common to all cloud setup scenarios
 * using the same clousource media/repositories. It shouldn't include setting up an
 * input model, which would mean specializing the CLM node to be used only with a particular
 * scenario. This job should also not require interaction with any of the other nodes in
 * the cloud. These restrictions are necessary to support the requirement of being able to
 * create a CLM node snapshot that can be reused to spin up several cloud setups based on
 * the same media and software channels.

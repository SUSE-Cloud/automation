            The virtual or hardware environment identifier. This field should either
            be set to one of the values associated with the known hardware environments
            (e.g. qe101), or to a value that will identify the created virtual environment.

            WARNING: if a virtual environment associated with the supplied cloud_env already
            exists, it will be replaced.

            The OpenStack cloud platform where the virtual cloud environment is

              susecloud - the Nuremberg SUSE cloud (cloud.suse.de)

            If the 'cloud_env' value matches one of the virtual cloud slots
            (https://ci.nue.suse.com/lockable-resources/), the 'os_cloud' parameter is
            overridden to reflect the OpenStack platform associated with it.

            This field may be used to define additional parameters,
            one per line, in the form PARAMETER_NAME=PARAMETER-VALUE.
            These parameters will be injected into the Jenkins job as
            environment variables that supplement or override the
            other parameters configured for the Jenkins job. This
            should not be used by default or regularly. It is meant to
            run job build customized in ways not already supported by
            the job's parameters, such as testing automation git pull
            requests with special configurations.

          description: >-
            The name of the OpenStack project that hosts the virtual cloud deployment
            in the 'os_cloud' OpenStack cloud platform (leave empty to use the
            default shared 'cloud' account).

            If the 'cloud_env' value (or the reserved resource, when 'reserve_env' selected),
            matches one of the virtual cloud slots (https://ci.nue.suse.com/lockable-resources/),
            the 'cloud-ci' OpenStack project used exclusively for the Cloud CI will be used
            regardless of this parameter.

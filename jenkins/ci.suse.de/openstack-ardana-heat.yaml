            This field may be used to define additional parameters, one per line, in the form:

              <parameter_name>=<parameter-value>

            These parameters will be injected into the Jenkins job as environment variables that supplement
            or override the other parameters configured for the Jenkins job.
            This should not be used by default or regularly. It is meant to run job build customized in ways
            not already supported by the job's parameters, such as testing automation git pull requests
            with special configurations.

Configure your mkcloud scripts here.

- Update/edit the SUSECloud.mkcloud script for global changes.
- Create a copy of the template script and name it as you like.
    - Keeping some naming consistency should be quite handy.
    - For instance $<username>.$<cloudname> should be quite useful for the same.
- These names are also reflected on the screen session during the deployment process.
- In case of shared hosts, strictly follow non-global/personal configuration edits in
    the copy configuration file created from the template file. Keep the SUSECloud.mkcloud
    configuration template untouched.
- Following the above for non-shared hosts should also be more beneficial and avoid
    unnecessary confusion, provides an easy lookup to see the given deployments configuration!

# Use this playbook for quick tests of the post-deployment checks
# without having to repeatedly go through a full deployment.  This
# assumes you already have a deployment which got as far as finishing
# the pre-deploy-checks.yml playbook and (at least partially)
# deploying Ardana.
#
# Run it from the same environment in which the original deployment
# was run, via:
#
#   ansible-playbook \
#     -e verification_temp_dir=/tmp/ardana-job-rpm-verification.XXXXXXXX \
#     test-post-deployment-checks.yml
#
# replacing XXXXXXXX with whichever temporary directory was already
# written to.

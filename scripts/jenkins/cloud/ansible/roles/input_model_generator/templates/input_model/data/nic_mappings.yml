  # nic-mappings are used to ensure that the device name used by the
  # operating system always maps to the same physical device.
  # A nic-mapping is associated to a server in the server definition.
  # The logical-name specified here can be used as a device name in
  # the network interface-models definitions.
  #
  # - name               user-defined name for each mapping
  #   physical-ports     list of ports for this mapping
  #     - logical-name   device name to be used by the operating system
  #       type           physical port type
  #       bus-address    bus address of the physical device
  #
  # Notes:
  # - The PCI bus addresses are examples. You will need to determine
  #   the values pertinent to your servers. These can be found with the
  #   the `lspci` command or from the server BIOS
  # - enclose the bus address in quotation marks so yaml does not
  #   misinterpret the embedded colon (:) characters

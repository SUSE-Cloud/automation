# Ardana testing via Jenkins

For SOC8, Ardana is deployed in a SUSEfied version (all sources come from
the [internal build service](https://build.suse.de/project/show/Devel:Cloud:8:Staging)).
The current testing is far away from perfect and a lot of things are missing
(e.g. pull request/changeset testing) but it's a first start to get a SUSEfied
Ardana environment up and running.

We currently have a [Jenkins job called
`openstack-ardana`](https://ci.nue.suse.com/job/openstack-ardana/) (defined in the
[`automation` git repo](https://github.com/SUSE-Cloud/automation/blob/master/jenkins/ci.suse.de/openstack-ardana.yaml))
which can be used to create a new environment in the [engineering
cloud](https://engcloud.prv.suse.net/).  The deployment can then be
accessed via the floating IP and used for debugging.

**PLEASE [DELETE YOUR ENVIRONMENT IN THE ENGINEERING
CLOUD](https://engcloud.prv.suse.net/project/stacks/) AFTER YOU ARE DONE**
(Jenkins job ID is in the Heat stack name). Otherwise we'll run into quota
limits in our project.

## Prerequisites

To be able to use the Jenkins job and login to a deployed env, you need:

* the cloud team login creds for https://ci.nue.suse.com (ask in the cloud-team RocketChat channel if you don't know what it is, and someone will PM you)
* your public ssh key added to [the list of keys](https://github.com/SUSE-Cloud/automation/blob/master/scripts/jenkins/ardana/ansible/group_vars/all/ssh_pub_keys.yml) (via normal github pull requests)

## Create a new environment

Start the deployment via [Build with
parameters](https://ci.nue.suse.com/job/openstack-ardana/build). The
available parameters should be self-descriptive. Here are some best
practices:

*   Use your Rocket/irc nickname as ```ardana_env```.
*   To test a different than the default model, adjust the
    ```model``` parameter in the deployment.
*   To test a custom automation repo, push to your fork and adjust
    ```git_automation_repo``` and ```git_automation_branch```

In the Jenkins log (also available as output in the Heat stack), the
variable ```DEPLOYER_IP``` is set to the floating IP. You can login as
root into the environment then.

## Automated checks

Some extra checks are automatically run by the Jenkins job:

- [rpm file checks](rpm-file-checks.md)

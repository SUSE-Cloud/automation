## Testing you changes

The syntax of the shell scripts is checked using
[bash8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bash8), you can install it running.

```
$ sudo pip install bash8
```

Once you have installed bash8 and the changes you wanted, you should check the
syntax of the shell scripts running `make test`, here is an example output of
a successful execution:

```
$ make test
cd scripts ; for f in *.sh mkcloud mkchroot jenkins/{update_automation,*.sh} ; do echo "checking $f" ; bash -n $f || exit 3 ; bash8 --ignore E010,E020 $f || exit 4 ; done
